                <h1>Amanda Delisle</h1>
                <h2>Artist and Entrepreneur</h2>

                <p>I was born with a propesity for artistic expression, using my natural color and design theory to create art for personal use. The love of mixed media and digital art led me to higher education in the field of digial communications. It
                    allows me to combine my love of beauty, technology, and commerce.
                </p>
                <p>I bought a metaphysical retail boutique on 5th street, downtown courtenay, in 2008. This education helps me with my own marketing and sales. I am always growing, searching beyond the boundaries of accepted reality. I enjoy crypto currency
                    platforms to continue gowing my wealth. I recently moved to a log home in the ontario woodlands, with the intention of focusing on total health and wellbeing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Honing my skills in the spiritual communities, I noticed a real lack of experience with marketing and design, and intend to niche into this field. It overlaps my passion for supporting the healing arts, and inner drive to make a positive difference in
                    the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want to further my education in UX/UI arena, as it is the perfect blend of creativity, problem solving, improving systems, and assisting people to interact seamlessly with technology. Please enjoy the sample projects below from my first year of school.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Peace, Amanda Delisle

                <p>These are some highlights from my portfolio from the first year in Digital Design Program.</p>

                    <h3>IN Design Experience</h3>
                    <p>This was a main project in our Typography course. I got to do all the layout and design. </p><br>
                    <p> There was a lot of research and design that went into this magazine, and on the inside of the cover, I placed my previous assignment which was an ad for a bike company.
                    </p><br>
                    <p> I got experience laying out brocures, books, title pages, pamphles, and then the mock magazine.</p>

                    <h3>Adobe XD Experience</h3>
                    <p>This was our main project for the term. I chose to create a room finder app since I have rented my full life and know how hard it is to find great places and roomates!
                    </p> <br>
                    <p> I chose the name, color pallet, did the logo design, designed the whole user flow, all the buttons and interactivity between screens. As an added bounus I custom designed the animation screens between activites. </p> <br>
                    <p>I am very pleased with how it turned out and would 100% use this if it were on market.
                    </p>

                    <h3>2D Drawing</h3>
                    <p>I loved this class and excelled in it. We used graphite pencils, ink, smudging sticks, and charcoal for the term. Very little colour was used to focus on the skill set behind drawing.</p><br>
                    <p>This images is a project where we needed to do our own composition and make it slightly fantasy. I love the 3D look, shading, and composition here of the play between candle, shell, and vase.</p><br>

                    <h3>Photography</h3>
                    <p> This was a very intense course, we took photos everyday on the mobile and cannon camera.</p><br>
                    <p>We used photoshop and illustrator for this course, as well as indesign to some extent.</p><br>
                    <p>For one of our main projects we needed to tell the story of how covid-19 effected us and our family. Since I am a small business owner, I chose to highlight the massive damage that the lockdowns caused for the business community. Many
                        stores were empty or had signs asking for support.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>I juxtaposed a colorful storefront image that you could see through showing the layers of complications to running a busienss during this time, stiched beside a black and white stark empty store or street.</p><br>
                    <p>The end product was powerful as it gave me a chance to speak up in a safe way</p><br>
