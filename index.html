        <h2>Artist and Entrepenure</h2>

        <p>Amanda is well versed in water color painting, which honed her color theory and abstract designs.  She loves mixed media and digital art 
          which allows her to combine her love of beauty, technology, and commerce.  Amanda owned her own metaphysical store for 15 years, and is now 
          taking advantage of some crypto currency platforms to continue to grow her wealth.  
        </p>
        <p>She is currently focused on health and wellbeing which led her to live in the woods in Ontario in her sisters retreat center.  With so much
          uncertainty this is one thing that she feels is paramount to an enjoyable lifestyle.  Her creatvity, self reflection, and life experiences allow
          her to help other spiritual people and businesss to be heard online.
