        <p>Amanda is well versed in water color painting, which honed her color theory and abstract designs.  She loves mixed media and digital art 
          which allows her to combine her love of beauty, technology, and commerce.  Amanda owned her own metaphysical store for 15 years, and is now 
          taking advantage of some crypto currency platforms to continue to grow her wealth.  
        </p>

          uncertainty this is one thing that she feels is paramount to an enjoyable lifestyle.  Her creatvity, self reflection, and life experiences allow
